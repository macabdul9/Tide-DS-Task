#### Note: 5 Fold cross validation results are reported here. Mean and Std value as (mean &pm; std). H2O results are for 80:20 split, could not do kfold validation as it is compute and memory heavy.



### To run the  `Tide-DS-Task.ipynb`
- Create python environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt
- Put your `data` in `data/` and starting running the notebook sequentially


### To run `evaluate.py`
- Make sure that you have `test` data in `data/` and H2O model weights in `models`
- Check the path in the evaluate.py and make sure that they're correct
- Run evaluate.py 


### Note: Complete results of the experiments can be found in `./results/`
